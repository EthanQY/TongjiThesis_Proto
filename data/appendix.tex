As one of the most widely used techniques in operations research, {\em mathematical programming} is defined as a means of maximizing a quantity known as {\em objective function}, subject to a set of constraints represented by equations and inequalities.
Some known subtopics of mathematical programming are linear programming, nonlinear programming, multiobjective programming, goal programming, dynamic programming, and multilevel programming$^{[1]}$.
